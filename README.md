# Library Database Management and Query System
## Goal
To design, build, and query a structured Library Database using SQL. The database system will track and record the library's members, books, and book loans.

## Tables
There are three active tables in the system. They are:
#### Books: records details of all books in the library catalogue
#### Members: keeps records of all members registered
#### Loans: tracks the movement of books through loans and returns.

## Project Execution
There are five phases to this project
### Phase 1: Database Setup
### Phase 2: Database Table and Schema Design
### Phase 3: Writing Basic SQL Queries
### Phase 4: Applying Comparison and Logical Operators
### Phase 5: Sorting, Filtering, and Limiting Results

## Insights drawn from the queries in the system
#### Below are some insights retrieved from the system based on the Queries written
List of books with more than 3 available copies
Books borrowed but yet to be returned
Members who registered at the Library before 2022
List of distinct book genres available at the Library
10 Most recent book loan not yet returned

## Learning Outcome
Working on this library Database Management system has helped to :
Understand how SQL databases model real-world systems
Experience what it means to design, build, and query a schema
Increase my level of confidence when working with SQL databases and querying them.
